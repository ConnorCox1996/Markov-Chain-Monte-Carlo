## Overview

This program implements the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in order to find the most probable graphs arising from a set number of nodes. For this program, the number of nodes is 4. User can specify the number of times the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is iterated. The relative probability of the graphs are given by the following function:

where,

This equation considers two sums. The first is the sum of all edge weights in a graph, multiplied by parameter r, which is set equal to 1. The second is the sum of the shortest distance from a source node to each other node in the connected graph, where the source node is set to node 0 @ a coordinate of (0,0)

Implementing the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, this program considers the current graph and a proposed graph to produce A, the probability of acceptance. If A=1, the proposed state is automatically accepted. A is calculated as follows:

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A%20%3D%20min%5C%7B%201%2C%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%20%28x_j%29%20q%28x_i%7Cx_j%29%7D%7B%5Cpi%20%28x_i%29q%28x_j%7Cx_i%29%7D%20%5C%7D)

A is then compared to a randomly generated decimal between 0 & 1, called u. The proposed state is accepted unless u > A.

The program runs through user specified iterations, comparing the current graph to proposed graphs, to find the most probable graph
